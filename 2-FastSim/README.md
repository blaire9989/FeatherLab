### Approximate Wave Simulations on Barbules
This directory contains our fast, approximate wave simulation code that computes scattering from different types of barbules. As verified with our full-wave simulations, our approximate simulation results are almost as accurate as the reference solutions, while the approximate methods gives rise to almost $1000 \times$ speedup.
