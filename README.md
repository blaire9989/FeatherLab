## FeatherLab
Open-source code base of the SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 paper, "Appearance Modeling of Iridescent Feathers with Diverse Nanostructures." For more details on our wave simulations and appearance modeling pipeline, please refer to the paper.

This repository contains our procedural geometric models for feather barbules, our fast approximate and slow reference wave simulators for computing barbule scattering, our feather BRDF generation pipeline, as well as our BRDF implementation in MitSuba3.
